### Strategies for finding film reviews

#### Use "subject terms" to identify film reviews
* [Atla Religion Database](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=ATLAReligion)
* [Arts & Humanities Database](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=PQArtHum)

#### Use "document type" to identify film reviews
* [Academic Search Premier](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=AcademicSearch)
* [Arts & Humanities Citation Index](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=WOSArHuCiIn)

#### Use popular (but credible!) web sources
* [Roger Ebert Reviews](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews)
* [The New Yorker](https://login.ezproxy.library.tufts.edu/login?url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive)


### ABC's of Evaluating web sources

#### Authority
* Who wrote it? Where was it published? Is the author listed along with his/her credentials? Usually a URL with .edu, .org. or .gov is more reliable than .com and .net.

#### Bias
* Is the online resource objective, presenting both sides of an issue?

#### Credibility
* Does the website document its claims? Does it accurately portray its subject matter?


#### Putting it into practice
* Using the strategies discussed above, find credible reviews on your chosen film.
* Using resources from the course guide, find relevant academic discussions of religion and film relevant to your project.
